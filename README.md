# road_detection
want to develop a GAN-based model which could deal with different type of senario and provide a stable road area detection
1.Why choose GAN? A: want to solve the problem that need collect all different type of training dataset. 
2.How to use GAN to solve this problemï¼ŸA: combine the segmentation structure and the GAN structure together. This idea will be based on AN and cycle-GAN.
